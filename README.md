# GPencilAddOn
Blender's grease pencil personal setup addon

# Goal

i have a routine setup i always do when i open a new blender scene preparing to make a 2d animation setup in the 3d viewport. It's becoming a little redundant now and i would like to use a script to automate all the setting up process. So i am going to create a simple script that i'll use as an addon so every time i need to recreate that setup, all i'll have to do will be to click on a button labeled "2d anime setup".
